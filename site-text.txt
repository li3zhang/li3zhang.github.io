“Hello world!”
Hi, I'm Li. Most acquantances would tell you I'm your average mild-mannered engineer, using math to make the world a better place. Although I do love appeasing our shareholders, I also spend a lot of time in line at Chipotle and losing balls at the golf course!

A particular set of skills.
I have worked in the oil and gas industry since I graduated in 2012. I’ve experienced production, drilling, and reservoir engineering – complete with field work where applicable! I’ve been known to use VBA to automate tedious processes.

There are many like it, but this one is mine.
When I'm not fighting crime and charming potential inlaws, I find out which programming languages the cool kids are learning and try to teach myself by making things.

Eggshell with Romalian type.
